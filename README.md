## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

cd simba-supermarket
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:

## Development

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Features Explained

### Multi-language Support
The app supports 3 languages via the `LanguageContext`. Switch languages from the navbar dropdown. Translations are managed in `lib/translations.ts`.

### Shopping Cart
Products can be added to cart from product cards. Cart state is persisted across the app using `CartContext`.

### Product Data
Products are loaded from `public/simba_products.json` and include 552 items across 9 categories with pricing and images.

## Key Components

- **Navbar**: Sticky navigation with logo, menu, search, language selector, theme toggle, and cart icon
- **ProductCard**: Displays product with image, name, price, and add-to-cart button
- **CategoryGrid**: Shows all product categories with item counts
- **Pagination**: Navigate between product pages

## Performance Notes

- Products are shuffled deterministically (seeded) to prevent hydration mismatches
- Images are lazy-loaded via Next.js Image optimization
- Search results are debounced to reduce re-renders
- CSS is optimized via Tailwind CSS tree-shaking

## Styling

The app uses **Tailwind CSS** with custom color scheme:

- **Primary Green**: `#16a34a` (Buttons, links, accents)
- **Secondary Amber**: `#f59e0b` (Highlights)
- **Navy Dark**: `#0f172a` / `#1e293b` (Dark backgrounds)
- **Light Background**: White with subtle borders

Dark mode uses complementary colors via `next-themes`.
